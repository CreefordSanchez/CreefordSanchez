## About me


Hello! My name is Creeford Sanchez, and I am a software developer in Winnipeg, Manitoba. <br>

I specialize in innovative and responsive software applications, which I enjoy making for people to use! I also love diving into side projects for fun, where I can explore new technologies and experiment with various programming techniques. <br>

I'm really obsessed in finding problem solving and tackling new challenges and I enjoy finding creative solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in coding. <br>
